              <p>
                Our analysis showed that car thefts were fairly evenly spread
                across brands and states like Gujarat, Maharashtra, and
                Rajasthan saw the highest theft volumes. Recovery rates stayed
                low across states and brands, even when aids like CCTV were
                present, suggesting other factors at play. Theft activity spiked
                in late spring and early fall, dipped in summer, and peaked at
                night for sedans and pickups, while mornings and convertibles
                saw fewer incidents.
              </p>

                With detailed features like theft timing, GPS installation, CCTV
                availability, location, and previous theft history already
                present in the dataset, future work could focus on combining
                these factors to uncover deeper patterns. Applying statistical
                analysis or machine learning models could help predict recovery
                likelihood or identify high-risk scenarios. Further improvement
                in data completeness across all regions, especially for
                currently missing states, would enhance the quality and accuracy
                of future insights.
