Visualization 1: Choropleth Map
In the choropleth map, the primary marks are geographic regions representing Indian states, each filled based on car theft data. The visualization uses color luminance as the main channel to encode theft frequency, with darker shades indicating higher counts. Spatial position is also an essential channel, as it leverages the viewer’s geographic knowledge to locate and compare states. Gray is used as a categorical color to indicate missing data. This choice of marks and channels enables a clean, map-based comparison of regional theft patterns, making it easy to spot geographic concentrations of high or low crime activity.

Visualization 2: Stacked Bar Chart
In this stacked bar chart, the marks are vertical rectangular bars, one per car brand, stacked to show the number of recovered and unrecovered vehicles. The chart uses vertical position and length as its main channels to encode the quantitative value of thefts, while color hue is used as a categorical channel to distinguish between recovered (green) and unrecovered (red) cases. Horizontal position encodes the different car brands. The combination of stacked structure and aligned position allows for both absolute and proportional comparisons within and across brands, making this visualization effective for understanding recovery outcomes at a glance.

Visualization 3: Grouped Bar Chart with Interactive Filtering
In this grouped bar chart, the primary marks are vertical rectangular bars that represent the percentage of recovered vehicles, grouped by recovery aid type. The chart uses vertical position as the main channel to encode quantitative magnitude, allowing precise comparisons between categories. Horizontal position is used as a categorical channel to separate "Yes" and "No" responses within each group. The bars are further organized into semantic groups based on the selected recovery aid (GPS Installed, CCTV Availability, Suspect Identified), and this grouping is controlled interactively through radio buttons. Color is either held constant or minimized to avoid introducing unnecessary visual encoding, keeping the viewer’s focus on position as the most perceptually accurate channel for comparing values.

Visualization 4: Line Chart with Rolling Average
This line chart uses line marks to represent two temporal trends: daily theft counts and a smoothed 30-day rolling average. The key channels are horizontal position for time and vertical position for the number of thefts. The raw data is plotted using a thin line to emphasize high-frequency variation, while the rolling average uses a thicker line to indicate long-term trends. Color hue differentiates the two lines, and stroke width is used as a secondary visual channel to guide attention to the smoother trend. This setup makes the visualization highly effective for spotting seasonal patterns, short-term spikes, and long-term shifts in theft activity.

Visualization 5: Heatmap
In the heatmap, the marks are rectangular grid cells, each representing a specific combination of car type and time of day. The primary channels are horizontal position for time of day and vertical position for car type, both used to encode categorical variables. The color luminance of each cell is used to encode the number of thefts (quantitative), with darker shades indicating higher values. The uniform shape and size of the marks ensure that only color varies across the grid, allowing the viewer to quickly identify hotspots of theft activity. This design supports efficient pattern recognition across two categorical dimensions simultaneously.
